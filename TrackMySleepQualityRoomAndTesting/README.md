TrackMySleepQuality - Final Code for 6.1 Room codelab
=====================================================

Final code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals Codelab 6.1 Room

Introduction
------------

TrackMySleepQuality is an app for recording sleep data for each night. 
You can record a start and stop time, assign a quality rating, and clear the database. 

This version of the app contains the Room database that holds the sleep data 
and instrumented tests to verify that this backend works. 


Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know:

* Building a basic user interface (UI) for an Android app, 
  using an activity, fragments, and views.
* Navigating between fragments and using Safe Args (a Gradle plugin) 
  to pass data between fragments.
* View models, view-model factories, and LiveData and its observers. 
  These Architecture Components topics are covered in an earlier codelab in this course.
* A basic understanding of SQL databases and the SQLite language.


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
